<p>JRPN is calculator simulator inspired by the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-16C" rel="nofollow">HP 16-C</a>
"Computer Scientist"
calculator that came out in 1982.  I've tried to make it work the same as a
real 16C, and to mimic the appearance as closely as possible.  This is a
completely clean-room implementation; I didn't have access to any of the
calculator's source code.  I just read the manual (very closely!), and ask a 
<a href="https://www.hpmuseum.org/forum/thread-16595-post-146096.html">question</a>
or two about how the real thing behaves, and I played around with a couple
of other simulators out there.
<p>
The User's Guide for this simulator is basically the HP-16C Owner's Handbook,
which can be easily found on the web.  A couple of little things are different:
<ul>
    <li>To access the functions you normally get by holding the on button and
        pressing another, you press the on button (with the calculator "on"),
        and then press the other button.  To turn the calculator off,
        you press "on" twice.
    <li>You can disable the windowing function.  If you do,
        then the digits on the LCD shrink so that they all fit.
        They get pretty small on a 64 bit binary number!  You can
        disable windowing from settings, or temporarily by pressing
        clear-prefix in integer mode.
    <li>You can copy the contents of the display to the clipboard.
    <li>From the menu, you can share the calculator state, either
        to/from the clipboard, or to an application.
    <li>The app can interpret a URL that contains an encoding of
        the calculator state.  This works in the web version, and
        also on the mobile versions:  Both iOS and Android apps
        register to intercept navigation to the calculator's domain.
    <li>If you want calculator programs to run faster, there's a 
        setting for that.  But watching the 7-segment flashing 
        "running" message is, to my mind, part of the fun!
</ul>

This is, in some sense, a 2.0 version of what I'm now calling 
<a href="https://legacy.jrpn.jovial.com">"Legacy JRPN"</a>, which in turn
was an adaptation of <a href="http://www.emmet-gray.com/" rel="nofollow">Emmet
