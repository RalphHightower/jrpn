**JRPN 16C or 15C?**

**Describe the bug**

**Debug Log**
If possible, a debug log would be great!  In JRPN, go to Menu -> Settings -> Capture Debug Log.  Then, operate the calculator to reproduce the problem.  Next, go to Menu -> Copy to Clipboard.  Then just paste your clipboard into the bug report.  Be sure to turn off debug logging in your settings when you're done!

The debug log captures calculator keystrokes, which gives me a nice, automated way of seeing exactly what's going on.  If you forget to turn of debug logging, nothing much bad happens -- every 1000 keystrokes, it resets the log, so it won't fill up memory.  But, all that extra stuff does take up some space, so you'll normally want it turned off.

**To Reproduce**
Tell me a bit about how to reproduce the problem.  This is especially important if you don't have a debug log!

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Platform:**
 If relevant, some details on the platform are sometimes helpful.
- OS: [e.g. Linux, MacOS, Android, iOS]
 - Browser, if applicable
 - Any relevant version information

**Additional context**
